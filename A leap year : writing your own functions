* In a Gregorian calendar, a normal year consists of 365 days, because the time required for the earth to revolve once about the sun is actually 365.2425 days. A "leap year" of 366 days is used once every 4 year and any year that is evenly divisible by 4
  is a leap year, for example 1988, 1992, and 1996 are leap years.
* However, there still a small error that must be accounted for. To eliminate error, the Gregorian calendar stipulates that year that is evenly divisible by 100 is a "leap year" only if it is also evenly divisible by 400.
* For this reason, the following years are not leap years:
  1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600
  This because they are evenly divisible by 100 but not 400. The following years are leap years: 1600,2000,2400. This is because they are evenly divisible by both 100 and 400.
